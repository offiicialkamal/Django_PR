## Overview
This is a Django web application that has been successfully imported and configured to run in the Replit environment. The project features a simple home page with dynamic navigation created via JavaScript and styled with CSS.

## Project Architecture
- **Framework**: Django 4.1.13
- **Database**: SQLite3 (default Django setup)
- **Package Manager**: uv (Python package management)
